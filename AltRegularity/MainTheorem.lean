# AltRegularity.MainTheorem

The main regularity theorem of the paper (Theorem 1.1).

**Theorem.** Let $(M^{n+1}, g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold with
$n \ge 2$. Let $\Phi$ be a non-excessive ONVP sweepout, and let $V$ be
the varifold limit of a min-max sequence $t_i \to t_0$. Then $V$ is a
stationary $n$-varifold with $\|V\|(M) = W$.

  * **(a) No mass cancellation.** If $\mathrm{Per}(\Omega_{t_0}) = W$,
    then $V$ is integral and (for $2 \le n \le 6$) $\mathrm{spt}\|V\|$ is
    a smooth, closed, embedded minimal hypersurface.

  * **(b) Mass cancellation, conditional.** If $\mathrm{Per}(\Omega_{t_0}) < W$,
    then $V$ has the same regularity conclusion provided the cancelled
    mass is integral. This reduces (via the rectifiability theorem and
    the sheet decomposition) to `PositiveDensityOnSupport` on the
    cancellation locus, equivalently `SweepoutWideReplacement` (still
    open at the level of the sweepout-wide construction).

## Proof structure

Both cases share the same chain
`Stationary + Integral + Stable + AlphaStructural ⟹ InClassSAlpha ⟹
SmoothMinimalHypersurface`. The two cases differ only in how integrality
is obtained:

  * (a) directly from `integrality_no_cancellation`
        (DLT perimeter-convergence criterion);
  * (b) from `integrality_with_cancellation` after positive density on
        the support is supplied by `positiveDensity_of_sweepoutWideReplacement`.

Stability and the $\alpha$-structural hypothesis come from
non-excessiveness via Section 7 of the paper, recorded as the two private
bridges below.

/-- The min-max varifold limit of a non-excessive ONVP sweepout is stable.

This is the content of Section 7's stability argument: the one-sided
homotopic-minimizer property (`Sweepout.innerHomotopicMinimizer_of_nonExcessive`)
implies the second-variation non-negativity on the regular part. -/

/-- **Theorem 1.1(a) — Main theorem, no-mass-cancellation case.**

Proof: chain stationarity (pull-tight), integrality (Theorem 6.1(a)),
stability and $\alpha$-structural (Section 7), then apply the smooth
regularity theorem for the class $\mathcal{S}_\alpha$. -/
